**This version is so far tailored for MACOS.**


Note
-----------------
1. 

Important Note: You **have to** install `Processing-java` first to have it support Processing format

How:

- Open Processing
- Tools -> Install `processing-java`


2. 

To have video file auto-play when opened, make sure you are using a video player that allows auto-play, it seems like mac's native Quicktime Player doesn't support that. So a 3rd-party player will be prefered like VLC. 

To test, simpley double-click a video file to see if the video player plays it when it opens. Because the spaceOS program won't **play** it, it just opens the file. So auto-play is needed.
